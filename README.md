# asp
Some VERY old ASP code.  We're talking a decade old or so.  I'm almost embarassed to even put some of this out there... no, actually, I kinda AM... but whatever, it's code, it worked at some point, maybe it'll help someone.

License?  Whatever.  Do what you want with it.  I don't even care if you give me credit for this stuff!
